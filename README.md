# Bryan English's Resume

I figured it was time to free my resume from the clutches of giant corporate
software, so I've rewritten it here in HTML. In the past, I've experimented with
TeX, Word, Google Docs and probably a few other tools, but I think HTML is the
clear winner going forward.

### Why?

HTML is win. There's no compiling, transpiling or converting to be done. It just
works. In every web browser.

### But what about printing? What if a prospective employer needs a PDF/DOCX?

First of all, anyone who absolutely requiring DOCX knows exactly where to shove
it.

Second, a PDF is easy enough to generate with "Print to PDF" and similar
features. Add in a touch of print CSS, and it's golden.

For the moment, this is just a rough draft. I need to style it a tad more, work
on better formatting, etc. Also note that **I'm not currently actively looking
for work**.
